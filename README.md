# kernel-process-dob-module
A Linux kernel module that spawns a 4-level deep child process tree using kernel threads and manages a dynamic in-kernel linked list to store randomly generated Date of Birth (DOB) entries. Demonstrates kernel-level process management, memory allocation (kmalloc), and linked list operations using list_head.
